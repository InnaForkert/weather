# Weather App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Main page shows saved cities in a form of cards, that display current weather. Cards have following functionality:
- display brief weather info;
- when clicked, direct to detailed weather page;
- have a button to refresh current weather in the city;
- have a button to delete the city.

There is a form to add a city.
Data is saved to local storage, so, when the page is reloaded, the city list is preserved and data is refreshed.

When detailed weather page is shown, hourly forecast appears in a form of a chart.
